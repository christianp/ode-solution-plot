ode-solution-plot
=================

A little tool to visualise solutions to first order ODEs.

It uses

* [LissaJS](https://github.com/numbas/LissaJS) to parse a mathematical expression and rewrite it as javascript
* [JSXGraph](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/) to render a diagram of the resulting vector field and solution.
